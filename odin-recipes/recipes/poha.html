    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> Poha (flattened rice) is typically a Western Indian breakfast recipe but it’s taste and ease of making has made it extremely popular all over India.

Poha is very easy to make, it requires almost no cooking, the flattened rice just need to be rinsed till it’s softened and that’s about it.

You don’t need to cook it like any other grain.

Traditionally in the state of Maharasthra, it is known as “kanda poha”  (kanda=onion) where poha is made with only onions and I prefer that version too.</p>
